 Title: Eulerian-Lagrangian Methods in Multiphase Flow: A Comprehensive Literature Review

Introduction:

Multiphase flow systems are ubiquitous in engineering and natural sciences, encompassing a wide range of industrial applications such as combustion processes, environmental studies, chemical reactions, and mineral processing. The accurate modeling of these complex phenomena is essential for the design and optimization of processes, as well as for predicting the behavior of multiphase flows under various conditions. Eulerian-Lagrangian methods offer a powerful framework to tackle multiphase flow problems by combining the advantages of both fixed grid (Eulerian) and moving particle (Lagrangian) descriptions.

In this literature review, we provide an overview of the research domain of Eulerian-Lagrangian methods in multiphase flows, highlighting their temporal scope and evolution. We discuss key trends and developments, including recent advancements in numerical techniques, parallelization strategies, and applications to various industries. Furthermore, we set the stage for a detailed analysis by introducing the underlying theoretical principles and describing the main categories of Eulerian-Lagrangian methods. The following sections aim to provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research in this domain, offering valuable insights into the latest developments, challenges, and future directions.

## Research Areas and Themes

 The literature on computational modeling in various fields shows a significant focus on understanding and optimizing complex systems. Three major research themes emerge: (1) multiphase flow modeling, encompassing fluid dynamics, heat transfer, mass transport, and phase transitions; (2) material science and engineering, including particle mechanics, reaction kinetics, and thermodynamics; and (3) interdisciplinary applications in engineering, energy systems, and biology. Interdisciplinary connections are strong, with researchers collaborating on topics such as sustainable energy conversion and waste-to-energy technologies. Emerging areas of focus include artificial intelligence and machine learning methods for improving model accuracy and reducing computational costs. Geographically, there is a noticeable concentration in Europe and North America, particularly in institutions known for their strong research programs in engineering and applied mathematics.

## Methodological Approaches

 The provided data represents a diverse range of research studies in the domain of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multi-phase flow modeling. Analyzing the methodological approaches employed in these studies reveals several dominant trends and patterns.

Firstly, CFD methods, particularly Finite Volume Method (FV), Finite Element Method (FEM), and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), are commonly used to simulate fluid flow and multi-phase phenomena. These methods have evolved over the years to handle complex geometries, turbulence modeling, and more accurate prediction of phase interactions.

Secondly, hybrid approaches combining Eulerian and Lagrangian methods have gained popularity in recent years. Such methods are particularly useful for simulating fluid-structure interaction, wake evolution, and multi-material flows. The flexibility of these approaches allows capturing the unique characteristics of various physical phenomena while maintaining numerical accuracy.

Thirdly, there is an increasing trend towards employing machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN)-based methods for predictive modeling in CFD. These methods offer advantages such as adaptability to complex systems and improved efficiency compared to traditional physics-based models. However, challenges remain in ensuring accuracy and validating the results of ML/ANN-based approaches.

Fourthly, strength and limitations of various methodological approaches depend on the specific application and physical phenomenon being studied. For instance, Eulerian methods are well-suited for handling complex geometries but struggle to capture free surface phenomena effectively. Lagrangian methods, on the other hand, excel in modeling free surfaces and particle interactions but require significant computational resources. As research progresses, it is essential to consider the strengths and limitations of each methodological approach when selecting an appropriate simulation technique for a given problem.

In conclusion, the domain of CFD and multi-phase flow modeling has seen a rich evolution of methodological approaches over the years. The ongoing trend towards hybrid methods, ML/ANN-based approaches, and increasing computational power promises to expand our understanding and predictive capabilities in this research area.

## Future Research Directions

 Future research directions in the domain of mathematical modeling for sustainable energy systems, particularly biomass conversion technologies, include several unresolved research questions and gaps. These include a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, and phase transitions during pyrolysis and gasification processes. Furthermore, the development of accurate models that account for the dynamic behavior of reacting systems and capture the effects of particle-fluid interactions is essential.

Emerging opportunities and challenges include the application of machine learning techniques to predictive modeling and process optimization, as well as the integration of advanced reactor designs with efficient mathematical models for optimal performance. Technological opportunities lie in the development of multiscale modeling approaches that bridge the gap between micro- and macro-scale simulations, enabling a more holistic understanding of biomass conversion processes.

Interdisciplinary research potential lies in collaborations between experts in areas such as materials science, chemical engineering, and computer science to advance modeling techniques and develop integrated solutions for sustainable energy systems. Practical applications include the design of efficient and cost-effective thermochemical reactors for biomass conversion, which can contribute significantly to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a circular economy. Societal impact includes the development of sustainable energy systems that provide affordable and accessible energy sources while minimizing environmental footprints.
